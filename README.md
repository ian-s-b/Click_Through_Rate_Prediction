# Click Through Rate Prediction
## Predict whether a mobile ad will be clicked using tensorflow random forests algorithms.

Click-through rate (CTR) is a very common way to predict if a certain ad will be clicked or not. This metric is the relationship between users who clicked on the ad and all users (taking into account those who clicked and those who did not). This way we can have a good visibility on whether an advertisement is effective or not.

The objectif of this project is to build a predicting model for CTR based on the following Avazu's data set, available on the kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data.

In other words, we want to predict the probability that an user is going to clik or not on a given advertisement.
